# LOV
We develop, Learning Origin Validation (LOV), a new mechanism specifically crafted to whitelist benign conflicts on the Internet-wide scale. The generated whitelist is offered to the ASes that employ ROV to validate RPKI-invalid routes. This involves matching the RPKI-invalid routes against the whitelist. If a match is found, the routes are considered benign, and border routers refrain from blocking them.
